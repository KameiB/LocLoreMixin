This is a Mixin that adds support for the much needed `LocLore` NBT tag.  

Minecraft **1.12.2** supports the `LocName` tag, which allows users to replace an item's name with a custom, translatable one.  
But Vanilla doesn't have that support for the `Lore` tag. That's where the `LocLore` tag comes in handy!  

You can test with this command:  
`/give @p stone 1 0 {display:{LocName:"tile.stone.andesiteSmooth.name",LocLore:["tile.shulkerBoxGray.name"]}}`  

You'll need to add the [Mixin Bootstrap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixinbootstrap) into your mods folder so any Mixin can load up!  

Remember to add your custom lang file and lang keys inside your resources folder or a Resource Pack!  
Example: `Â§cThis is a red text`
